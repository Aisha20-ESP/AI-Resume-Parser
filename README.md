# AI-Resume-Parser
A machine learning model for parsing resumes.
Recruiters and corporate HR teams struggle to scan thousands of qualified resumes. They either need a lot of people to do it, or they're running out of qualified candidates. This is a waste of time, money, and productivity for the company.

To solve this problem, our resume analyzer application can take in resumes, analyze the necessary fields and categorize them. This resume analyzer uses the popular Python library - Spacy for OCR and text classifications. We first train our model with these fields, then the application can select the values of these fields from the newly entered resumes.

The resume dataset includes the following fields:
Name
Profile
Address
Professional experience
Education
Competences 
Year of graduation
Companies frequented
Center of interest
